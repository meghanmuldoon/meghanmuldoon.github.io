<h1>Independent Proposal</h1>
<p>My project will be a redesign of my 317 project that I created last semester. This project will be named “Guild.” “Guild” is the name of the potential app that my partner and I created last semester. With this redesign, I will be using Figma instead of Adobe XD in order to acquire a new technical skill. This app allowed artists and creatives to network, find work, make connections as well as seek events related to their medium. The goal of this project is to create a networking app that is effective for artists and creatives. Many networking and employment apps and interfaces do not account for how different the job market is for artists and creatives. This app should also be available to all kinds of artists and people. One goal for this app is to generate collaboration between its users. For example, a painter might collaborate with a digital artist, or a dancer and an actor might meet on this app and collaborate. Another goal for this app is to create a space that does not set many “defaults” for the user. The app should not assume gender or use language that assumes who the user is. The audience for this app is young creatives and artists who are entering the job market. For example, actors who are just entering the industry might be able to find young directors who need actors on this app. This app would also allow for older more seasoned professionals to network and post jobs as well. The first deliverable I will be completing is User Research, this portion of the project should be completed by February 19th. The second deliverable is UX Design & Prototyping. This section of the project should be done by February 28th. And the final portion that I will complete for this project is a Design Presentation. This will be completed by March 5th.</p>
